AUTH-SERVICE: DOMAIN LAYER DESIGN SPECIFICATION
===========================================================

This domain layer follows a "Strict Capsule" Hexagonal Architecture. 
The goal is zero-trust: we never assume input data is valid.

1. THE COMPONENT HIERARCHY
   [Raw Data] -> [Factory] -> [Value Objects] -> [Aggregate]

2. SECURITY THROUGH VISIBILITY
   - Aggregates: All constructors are PACKAGE-PRIVATE. 
   - Factories: All creation methods are PUBLIC.
   Result: It is physically impossible to create an Aggregate 
   without going through a Factory.

3. PERSISTENCE PATTERN ("DB Returns String")
   Our factories support a .reconstitute() method. This method 
   accepts raw Strings from SQL or Redis and parses them into 
   Domain Types. If the database is corrupted, the Factory 
   will throw an exception before the domain logic executes.

4. PORT DEPENDENCY INJECTION
   For complex Value Objects (Passwords, UserAgents), we use 
   Ports (Interfaces). The Domain defines the Port; the 
   Infrastructure implements it. The Factory orchestrates them.
